## Overview

Balancelynx is a high-performing, programmable, double-entry bookkeeping ledger offered over
a developer-friendly REST API.

## Feature Highlights

### Flexible Account Hierarchy
Balancelynx redefines the traditional hierarchy of a *Chart of Accounts*. Instead of
a limiting parent-child relationship, AccountGroups group Accounts and other
AccountGroups together.

### User-Defined Functions
Accounts and AccountGroups can perform checks on Transactions involving them through
Javascript User-Defined Functions (UDFs). UDFs allow flexible customization of account
behaviors suiting a wide range of unique business needs.

### Opt-In Immutability
Depending on your needs, you can configure a Balancelynx ledger to be immutable, or
not.

### Multi-Commodity Support
Balancelynx allows you keep track of anything you can count, from US Dollars, to Billable
Hours, and from Tradable Commodities to Inventory Items.

### Indexable Metadata (on the roadmap)
All Balancelynx objects permit user-defined metadata field, represented as a simple JSON
object. You can define indices on keys contained in metadata, allowing you to rapidly
retrieve them.

## Roadmap
Our roadmap includes the following features:
* GraphQL
* Indexable Metadata
* Bi-directional interoperability with `ledger-cli` files.
* Webhooks
* Integrated bi-directional syncing with banking providers
* gRPC
