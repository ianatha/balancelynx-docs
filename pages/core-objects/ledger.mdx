## Ledger
A ledger is completely isolated from any other ledger.

You can't move commodities between accounts on different ledgers.

For example, if your usecase is an expense reporting SaaS, you would generally
have a `Ledger` per business, and a `Ledger` per individual user.

That would allow you to sync each individual user's personal credit cards into
a separate `Ledger`, and to track pending and remitted expense reports in
the business's `Ledger`.
