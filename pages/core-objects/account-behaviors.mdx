# Account Behaviors

Account Behaviors validate Transactions about to be posted to an Account.

You can use Balancelynx's [Predefined Account Behaviors](#predefined-account-behaviors), or [define your own using TypeScript](#user-defined-functions).
Your JavaScript code runs in an isolated Javascript sandbox within Balancelynx.

## Predefined Account Behaviors

Balancelynx ships with some pre-defined Account Behaviors that you can reference by name:
* `only_debits`
* `only_credits`
* `only_positive_amounts`
* `must_positive_balance`
* `must_negative_balance`
* `no_transactions`

## User-Defined Functions

A User-Defined Function defining an Account Behavior must have the following signature:
```typescript
type AccountBehaviorFunction = (acct: any, tx: any, posting: any) => Promise<true|string>;
```

For example, to require that all postings to an account have a `correlation_id` in their
metadata, you could define an Account Behavior as follows:

```typescript copy
import { AccountBehaviorFunction } from "fineng";

const requireCorrelationId: AccountBehaviorFunction = (acct, tx, posting) => {
	if (!posting.metadata?.correlation_id) {
		return `${acct.id} requires that all postings contain a correlation_id`;
	}
	return true;
}
```

This will result to `requireCorrelationId.toString()` looking something:
```
"(acct, tx, posting)=>{\n    if (!posting.metadata?.correlation_id) {\n        return `${acct.id} requires that all postings contain a correlation_id`;\n    }\n    return true;\n}"
```

Then, you could update an existing account to execute that Account Behavior prior to accepting any [Transactions](transaction).
```typescript copy
updateAccount({
	// ...
	behaviors: [{
		"type": "function/v0",
		"src": requireCorrelationId.toString(),
	}, {
		"type": "predefined",
		"name": "only_debits"
	}],
});
```

You could also impose an Account Behavior to an [Account Group](account-group):
```typescript copy
updateAccountGroup({
	// ...
	behaviors: [{
		"type": "function/v0",
		"src": requireCorrelationId.toString(),
	}],
});
```
