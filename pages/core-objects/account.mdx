## Account

*Accounts* hold balances of [Commodities](commodity), along with a record of activity in
the form of [Transactions](transaction#postings) posted to them.

Accounts may also have [Account Behaviors](account-behaviors) attached to them, whether
these Behaviors are [JavaScript User-Defined Functions](account-behaviors#user-defined-functions),
or [Predefined Account Behaviors](account-behaviors#predefined-account-behaviors).
Account Behaviors validate [Transactions](transaction) before they are posted.
