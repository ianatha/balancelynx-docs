## Numerical Accuracy

Arbitrary precision numbers, using a rational representation, which avoids loss of precision.

For example, assume that a value of $1.00 is split equally amongst 3 accounts.
Each account now has $1/3. The sum of $1/3 + $1/3 + $1/3 is still $1.

The balance of each account is 0.33.
Assume that all 3 players withdraw $0.33, and the journaling system permits it,
although $1/3 - $0.33 = 0.00333333333 which is also to say $1/3 > $0.3333.

Which means we have lost $0.01
