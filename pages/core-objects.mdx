## Core Objects

Balancelynx revolves around `Commodities` being moved between `Accounts` via `Transactions`.
`Accounts` are grouped together in `AccountGroups`.

Optionally, you can use `Vouchers` to codify a mapping between your business logic and Balancelynx `Transactions`.

A powerful feature of Balancelynx is User-Defined Functions. Before a `Transaction` is posted, it must satisfy the requirements posed by the
User-Defined Functions (UDFs) of all involved `Accounts` and `AccountGroups`.

Lastly, a `Ledger` is an isolated container of all other objects.
