## Transactions

*Transactions* move amounts of [Commodities](commodity) between [Accounts](account).

## Postings

The amount to be credited, or debited, to each [Account](account) is indicated in a *Posting*. All
transactions must balance, which means that the total amount credited must equal to the
total amount debited. Since a Posting can either debit or credit, a Transaction needs at
least two *Postings* to balance.

## Sample Transaction
The Javascript representation of an example transaction is:
```typescript
const transaction = {
	postings: [
		// withdrew $1000.49 from my Checking account
		{ account: acct_Checking, debit: 1000_49, commodity: USD },
		// and paid $1000.00 towards Rent
		{ account: acct_Expenses_Rent, credit: 1000_00, commodity: USD },
		// and $0.49 for banking fees
		{ account: acct_Expenses_BankFees, credit: 49, commodity: USD },
	],
};
```

## Distinguishing between Credits and Debits
Postings explicitly separate credit movements of Commodities from debit movements.
While some ledger software presumes that a negative amount is a debit, and a
positive amount is a credit, we distinguish between them. This permits you to
represent a greater variety of real-world situations, while keeping reporting
straightforward. For example, by representing reversal transactions in an
Account representing a Credit Card as negative debits, but earned rewards as
positive credits, we can easily determine the total expenses (the sum of all debits)
without any ad hoc logic to exclude earned rewards.

Consider the following scenario, where a $10 charge gets posted against an account representing a credit card:
```typescript
const original = postTransaction({
	postings: [
		{ account: expenses_misc, credit: 100, commodity: USD },
		{ account: credit_crd, debit: 100, commodity: USD },
	]
})
```

Assuming that we later on need to void that $10 charge and make it as if it never happened, while keeping our ledger immutable.
This means that no records should be erased, but the $10 charge shouldn't appear in any reporting whatsover. We'd issue:
```typescript
const reversal = postTransaction({
	postings: [
		{ account: expenses_misc, credit: -100, commodity: USD },
		{ account: credit_crd, debit: -100, commodity: USD },
	],
})
```

This way, the **debits balance** will be whatever it was before the original transcation.

## Transactions with Multiple Commodities
TODO

## Rejected Transactions
A transaction can be rejected when it doesn't pass the checks imposed by the Behaviors of all involved Accounts and AccountGroups.

For example the following code,
```typescript
const expense_accounts = createAccountGroup({
	accounts: [
		acct_Expenses_Rent,
		acct_Expenses_BankFees,
	],
	behaviors: [
		// TODO
	],
});

const reversal = postTransaction({
	postings: [
		{ account: expenses_misc, credit: -100, commodity: USD },
		{ account: credit_crd, debit: -100, commodity: USD },
	],
});
```
will result to a `RejectedTransactionException` containing the following information:
```json
{
	"asdf": "Asdf"
}
```
